## macOS bluetooth troubleshooting
Pairing with macOS can be quite a pain and usually requires a number of resetting/unpairing/re-pairing combinations to get to work again.
The following has worked for me before:
* Turn off bluetooth
* Turn on bluetooth
* Remove keyboard from bluetooth pairing
* Clear bluetooth profile on the keyboard
* Connect to keyboard again
* While it's connecting, switch to a different layer


Once the keyboard is paired it generally stays paired. There are some issues with re-connecting after waking up the computer from sleep, but turning bluetooth off and on again should get the keyboard to connect.
